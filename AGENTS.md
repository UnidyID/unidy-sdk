- use biome to lint/format before pushing code
- run `bun run build` inside of packages/sdk if you changed any code inside to regenerate potential changes in README.md files generated by Stencil
- try to run the e2e tests locally to confirm that they are still passing. 

- Use conventional commit messages (prefix messages with `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:` etc.)
- Do not add a "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footer to commits
- When creating PRs, always assign @me and add reviewers: bvogel,Zeko369,MandyGottschling,Sokre95 excluding the current user from this list

- when touching front end code that is user facing test it for accessibility and adjust it to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- if keys are added to locale files always respect alphabetical order

- Stop making more suggestions after your suggestions have been rejected or rolled back twice, rather ask for user guidance

## Stencil Store Reactivity
`@stencil/store` handles reactivity automatically. Access store state directly in the render method - re-renders trigger automatically when state changes. See https://stenciljs.com/docs/v2/stencil-store#storestate

```tsx
// ✅ Stencil handles reactivity
render() {
  if (authState.step === "email") { ... }
}
```

**Exception: Slotted components** - Components rendered inside a `<slot>` may not re-render when store state changes. Use a `@State()` trigger with subscriptions:
```tsx
@State() private renderTrigger = 0;
private unsubscribers: (() => void)[] = [];

connectedCallback() {
  const triggerRender = () => { this.renderTrigger++; };
  this.unsubscribers.push(onChange("step", triggerRender));
}
disconnectedCallback() {
  this.unsubscribers.forEach((unsub) => unsub());
}
render() {
  void this.renderTrigger; // Establish dependency
  // ... use authState directly
}
```

## Component Mixins

### UnidyComponent
Base mixin for all components. Accepts additional mixin factories and provides `this.logger` and `this.element`
```tsx
export class MyComponent extends UnidyComponent() { ... }
export class MyComponent extends UnidyComponent(HasSlotContent) { ... }
```

### HasSlotContent
Mixin for slot content detection. Provides `this.hasSlot` (auto-detected in connectedCallback).
