- use biome to lint/format before pushing code
- run `bun run build` inside of packages/sdk if you changed any code inside to regenerate potential changes in README.md files generated by Stencil
- try to run the e2e tests locally to confirm that they are still passing. 

- Use conventional commit messages (prefix messages with `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:` etc.)
- Do not add a "Co-Authored-By: Claude" footer to commits
- When creating PRs, always assign @me and add reviewers: bvogel,Zeko369,MandyGottschling,Sokre95 excluding the current user from this list

- when touching front end code that is user facing test it for accessibility and adjust it to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- if keys are added to locale files always respect alphabetical order
